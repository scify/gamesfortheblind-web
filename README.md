## About the project

[gamesfortheblind.org](https://gamesfortheblind.org) is an online repository for games that are especially designed to
be tailored to the needs of the blind, by [SciFY](https://scify.org/en/project/leap-games-for-the-blind-2/)

**LEAP (Listen – LEArn – Play)** is a series of electronic games specifically designed for blind children.

* The first game, Tic-Tac-Toe, teaches the children to use the basic computer keys as well as how to navigate in an
  auditory two-dimensional space.

* With Tennis, children perceive movement and speed through three-dimensional sound.

* The last game of this series, Curve, is of an educational nature and combines the skills and abilities developed in
  the
  two previous games to bring typical optical educational procedures into the auditory space.

## High innovation - Features

* The games were awarded at
  an [international level](https://scify.org/en/news/%ce%b2%cf%81%ce%b1%ce%b2%ce%b5%cf%85%cf%83%ce%b7-%cf%83%ce%b5-%cf%80%ce%b1%ce%b3%ce%ba%cf%8c%cf%83%ce%bc%ce%b9%ce%bf-%ce%b5%cf%80%ce%af%cf%80%ce%b5%ce%b4%ce%bf-%ce%b3%ce%b9%ce%b1-%cf%84%ce%b7-scify/)
  for their innovation in accessibility support.
