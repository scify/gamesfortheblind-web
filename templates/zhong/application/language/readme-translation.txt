  ~~~ TRANSLATIONS ~~~

If you want to translate one of our templates follow the steps below. Please, if you translate one of our tempaltes send us the translated file and we will make it available from the next release. PLUS, we will give you a discount for the purchase of one template. Contact us for more info!

> NOTE: If you are not a programmer and you don't know PHP, contact us and we will send you a plain language file to translate.

> If are a programmer or you understand PHP then follow these steps:
- copy one of the language directory ( for instance, the directory "en-GB" )
- rename the directory name and the files depending on your language ( for instance: I want to translate the template to italian; I must rename the directory "en-GB" to "it-IT" and the file "en-GB_template.php" to "it-IT_template.php" )
- translate the content of the PHP file ( DO NOT change the name of the variables )
- edit the file "TEMPLATE_ROOT_DIR/application/handlers/language-handler.php"
- modify the language handler script by adding a new "switch-case" statement
- send us the translated file so it will be available to other users

Thank you :)
